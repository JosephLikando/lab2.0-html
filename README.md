I opened a new folder and created two files (README.md and index.html). 
I edited index.html in vs code by copying and pasting the code given in the assignment. 
I then added my name and computer number as specified in the assignment 
I then used w3c validator to find errors and afterwards I fixed them as directed by the validator 
I then the added ( git add .), committed the changes (git commit -m "message") and pushed (git push origin main) the changes to github 
I then forked my partner's repository, cloned it and then added my name in her index.html file
